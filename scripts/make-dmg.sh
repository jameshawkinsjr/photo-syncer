# build/Photo-Syncer-<version>.dmg, compressed, signed, with the usual
# drag-to-Applications window.

#   scripts/make-dmg.sh
#
# Environment (see scripts/common.sh for the signing variables):
#   NOTARY_PROFILE      Name of a notarytool keychain profile. When set, and the
#                       app is signed with a Developer ID certificate, the image
#                       is notarized and stapled so it opens on other Macs
#                       without a Gatekeeper warning. Create the profile once
#                       with `xcrun notarytool store-credentials`.
#
# Without a Developer ID certificate the image is still signed, but macOS will
# warn people who download it that it can't be verified; they can allow it
# under System Settings > Privacy & Security.
